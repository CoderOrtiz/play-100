# Play üíØ

Practicing JavaScript from what I Have Learned So Far

## Description:

Welcome to Play 100! Player 1 begins by pressing the ‚ÄúROLL DICE‚Äù Button, at which time a number between 1 through 6 will be rolled. If Player 1 rolls a 1, their turn will be automatically skipped to Player 2 and their current score will be set to 0. The same rules apply to Player 2. The goal of either player is to accumulate as many ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù points from their dice rolls, before they roll a 1. Either Player can ‚ÄúHOLD‚Äù their current score, which will be saved as their overall score and be safe from being wiped out. The first Player to reach an overall score of 100 or more wins the game!

## Topics Covered within This Project:

1. Using the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML and CSS.

2. Incorporated a For Loop for additional practice with For Loops to have all values set back to 0 at the beginning of the game and when a user resets the game. 

3. Writing Function Declarations, Function Expressions, Arrow Functions and adding Click Events to said Functions.

4. Adding Game Logic using If Else Statements.

5. Gaining additional Refactoring Experience within the JavaScript File.

6. Added the option for users to add their unique names to the Player 1 and Player 2 Variables. If they choose not to enter their names, the names will default to Player 1 and Player 2.

7. Generated a pseudo random number, and with Template Literals, would select a dice image to display to users as well as display the generated number as the "current" score.

8. Learning about += and how to utilize it.

9. Selecting elements 0 and 1 within an array and manipulating said elements.

10. I learned how to Disable Buttons in JavaScript utilizing Stack Overflow.

## How I Did, What I Changed, and my Final Thoughts:

This was a fun challenge! I struggled with adding the roll score as the current score as well as "holding" the "current score" to the saved score. I reverted to taking peak at Jonas' instruction to overcome these hurdles. I am proud to say, besides these two topics, I was able to create the rest of the JavaScript File solly by myself! For this project I really wanted to do it myself as I know I have learned a lot of what was required for this project.

I added a few features to this project. When the player reaches a score of 100 or more, the background turns green. The users playing the game can add their own names instead of only being listed as Player 1 and Player 2. I really wanted to incorporate a Modal Window as I have just learned about them and how to create them. The way I decided to incorporate one was by explaining the instructions using it. I also added a button titled, "Instructions", that will open the Modal Window if either user needs to review the instructions again. I added three ways to close the Modal Window. You can close the Modal Window by hitting the X button, clicking anywhere outside of the Modal Window, and by pressing the "esc" button on the user's keyboard.

My Final Thoughts are that this was a great project to test and grow my skills using JavaScript. I am excited for the next project and to show this one to my family and friends.
