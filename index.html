      <h1>Welcome to Play 💯!</h1>
      <p>
        Player 1 begins by pressing the “ROLL DICE” Button, at which time a
        number between 1 through 6 will be rolled. If Player 1 rolls a 1, their
        turn will be automatically skipped to Player 2 and their current score
        will be set to 0. The same rules apply to Player 2. The goal of either
        player is to accumulate as many “current” points from their dice rolls,
        before they roll a 1. Either Player can “HOLD” their current score,
        which will be saved as their overall score and be safe from being wiped
        out. The first Player to reach an overall score of 100 or more wins the game! May
        the odds ever be in your favor 😈
